Change between idosal/scira-mcp-ui-chat and zaidmukaddam/scira-mcp-chat repositories:
1. MCP-UI Integration and Focus Shift: The fork is now called "MCP-UI Playground Chat" and incorporates mcp-ui for UI rendering of tool call results. This new focus is now emphasized in the README and various components.
Why: This is a blatant product refocus that makes the app a showcase for the mcp-ui project and a playground for mcp-ui features, allowing for richer UI-driven chat experiences.

2. Addition of MCP-UI Dependencies: Package.json now includes the new dependencies @mcp-ui/client and @mcp-ui/server, and the code is modified to utilize them.
Why: To make it possible to render tool responses as interactive user interface elements, utilizing the MCP-UI framework to facilitate sophisticated user engagement.

3. Major Redesign of the User Interface Theme ("Ocean" Theme)
Change: The app now has a new "ocean" theme with updated CSS, theme toggles, and component classes.
Why: To give the playground a unique visual identity, update its appearance and feel, and better align with the new focus.

4. Disabled OpenAI and XAI Model Support
Change: Only the Anthropic and Groq models are left in the AI providers; the integration of the OpenAI and XAI models has been commented out.
Why: Probably to simplify provider support, simplify things, or deal with API key management for demonstration or testing.

5. Database Chat Storage/History Features Are Removed
Change: All backend and frontend code pertaining to creating titles, retrieving chat history, and storing chats and messages in the database has been commented out or eliminated.
Why: To make the app easier to use for demo and playground purposes by eliminating the need for database setup and persistent user data.

6. Improved Tool Invocation System for User Interface Actions
Change: To support interactive actions, callback handling from tool-generated UI components, and HtmlResource rendering, the ToolInvocation component has been rewritten.
Why: To show dynamic tool integration by enabling the chat to display tool outputs as interactive UI elements in addition to text.

7. Change to the Default MCP Server and Server Management Customization: The application now automatically injects a demo MCP-UI server and simplifies the server management process by eliminating advanced configuration UIs and always including the demo.
Why: To eliminate the need for manual configuration and make it simple for users to get started and observe the playground in operation.

8. General UI/UX Streamlining Change: A lot of UI elements have been simplified, sidebar content has been cut down, and some features (like advanced server configuration and API key management) have been hidden or commented out.
Why: To minimize distractions in a demo setting and direct user attention to the MCP-UI playground features.

9. Updates to Metadata and Branding
Modification: "MCP-UI Playground" is now referenced in all app titles, OpenGraph/Twitter images, and project overview content along with new image assets.
Why: To promote the fork as a demonstration for an alternative use case and to clearly decouple it from the upstream project.

10. README and Documentation Overhaul Change: The README has been revised to include more information about MCP-UI features, how to use the demo server, and the new emphasis on general-purpose chat.
Why: To explain how to use the playground with custom MCP servers and to assist users who are interested in mcp-ui.

In summary:
With an emphasis on interactive tool user interfaces, streamlined setup, and a contemporary visual identity, the forked repository has evolved into a highly targeted demo and playground for the mcp-ui library.
The main modifications eliminate persistent chat history/database features and broaden the user interface to highlight MCP-UI capabilities, making it a perfect place for developers to begin experimenting with MCP-UI-powered chat applications.
