# MCP Chat L3 Merge & Setup Summary

## Overview
This document details the process of performing a Level 3 (L3) merge for the MCP Chat project, the challenges encountered, and the solutions applied. It also covers the final environment setup and validation steps.

---

## 1. Merge Process
- Remotes for both fork and upstream repositories were set up.
- The latest changes from both sources were pulled.
- A Level 3 merge (`git merge upstream/main`) was initiated.

### Challenges
- Multiple merge conflicts in key files: `chat.tsx`, `markdown.tsx`, `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `README.md`.

### Solution
- VS Code and manual review were used to resolve each conflict.

---

## 2. Code Conflict Resolution
- Logic/UI in `components/chat.tsx` and `components/markdown.tsx` was carefully merged.
- The best features and UI from both branches were preserved.
- `package.json` dependencies were cleaned and merged.

### Challenges
- Overlapping or duplicate logic in markdown/code rendering.
- Conflicting or duplicate dependencies in `package.json`.

### Solution
- Code was merged by hand, tested for correctness, and all conflict markers were removed.
- `package.json` was validated with a fresh install.

---

## 3. Dependency & Lockfile Management
- Old `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `node_modules` were deleted.
- `pnpm install` was run to regenerate the lockfile and install dependencies.

### Challenges
- Lockfile conflicts could not be resolved by hand due to file size and complexity.
- Regenerating the lockfile sometimes did not work due to hidden dependency mismatches.

### Solution
- Ensured `package.json` was clean and up to date before regenerating the lockfile.
- The clean install process was repeated until all issues were resolved.

---

## 4. Build & Run
- The app was built using `npm run build` (Next.js with Turbopack).
- The app was started with `npm run start`.

### Challenges
- Error: “Could not find a production build in the '.next' directory.”
- Runtime errors related to missing environment variables for the database and Groq API key.

### Solution
- `npm run build` was run before `npm run start` to generate the production build.
- Missing environment variables were diagnosed and a `.env` file was created.

---

## 5. Environment Variable Setup
- A `.env` file was created with the following keys:
  - `GROQ_API_KEY` (provided)
  - `DATABASE_URL` (Neon Tech Cloud SQL link provided)
  - Placeholders for `XAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`

### Challenges
- Errors about missing database connection and Groq API key.
- Incorrect formatting (quotes around values) in the `.env` file.

### Solution
- The `.env` file was updated to remove quotes and ensure correct formatting.
- The app was restarted to apply the new environment variables.

---

## 6. Final Testing & Validation
- The app was verified to build and run without errors.
- All features, including database and API integration, were confirmed to work as expected.

### Challenges
- Initial runtime errors due to missing or misconfigured environment variables.

### Solution
- The `.env` file was carefully checked and updated.
- All required services (database, APIs) were confirmed to be accessible.

---

## .env Example
```
# Environment variables for MCP Chat project
# Fill in your actual API keys and database URL below

XAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
GROQ_API_KEY="Groq api key here"
DATABASE_URL="postgreSQL URL link here"
```

| Build & Run                 | Missing build, runtime env errors              | Build before start, set up `.env`             |
| Env Variable Setup          | Missing/incorrect env vars, formatting issues  | Add correct values, remove quotes             |
| Final Testing               | Runtime errors                                 | Validate `.env`, restart app                  |
