Folder Structure Overview:

1. app: The Next.js App Router's primary directory. It includes the application's main pages, layouts, and entry points.
Contents:
layout.tsx: Specifies the application's root layout.
usually consists of common elements such as navigation bars, headers, and footers.
page.tsx: Denotes the application's home page, such as the homepage.
This is the app's default path.
Global CSS styles that are used throughout the application are contained in globals.css.
providers.tsx: Offers the application state management and global context.
Global services like theme providers, authentication, and API clients are initialized here.

2. components
Its reusable user interface elements serve a variety of purposes within the application.
Contents:
chat-sidebar.tsx: A component for the chat sidebar.
Most likely used for information display related to chat or navigation.
An API key management component is api-key-manager.tsx.
might have the ability to add, edit, or remove API keys.
A component for controlling MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers is mcp-server-manager.tsx.
probably has features for interacting with and connecting to external backend servers.
ui/: A subfolder with smaller, reusable user interface elements.
Examples include separators, modals, buttons, and other design components.

3. lib: Contains context providers and utility functions that are utilized throughout the application.
Contents: context/mcp-context.tsx: Controls MCP servers' logic and state.
gives users access to MCP-related data across the application using a React Context.
Files for utilities:
may consist of helper functions for data formatting, API calls, or other common logic.

4. hooks
There are custom React hooks in this folder.
Reusable functions that contain logic (such as retrieving data or managing state) are called custom hooks.
For instance:
A hook to communicate with MCP servers.
a hook to control session state or user authentication.

5. public
The application serves the static assets in this folder directly.
Examples include logos, icons, and pictures.
static files, such as favicon.ico or robots.txt.

6. ai: Provides reasoning for AI-related operations.
Contents: Custom AI models and integration with AI providers, such as OpenAI.
features for working with or processing AI models.

7. drizzle
The configuration for drizzle ORM, a TypeScript ORM that is lightweight and useful for database interaction, is contained here.
Contents: Definitions of database schemas.
setup for the database connection.
Database querying and updating utility functions.

Separation of Frontend and Backend
Front-end
Next.js, a framework based on React, is used to build the frontend.
It manages: Rendering components and pages.
utilizing custom hooks or React Context to manage client-side state.
interacting with backend services or external APIs.

Backend
Although this repository integrates with external backend services, it lacks a dedicated backend folder.
Most likely, backend functionality is offered by:
Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers:
These servers manage data and process AI models, among other backend-like functions.
These servers are accessed by the frontend through API calls.
Drizzle ORM:
Drizzle ORM is set up to communicate with a database if one is used.

Component Flow: 
1. Initialization of the App:
   Global providers (providers.tsx) are wrapped around the application by layout.tsx.
   The layout includes shared elements such as chat-sidebar.tsx.
   Rendering a page:

2. Page.tsx initializes state or retrieves data.
   renders elements such as api-key-manager.tsx and chat-sidebar.tsx.
   Management of the State:

3. mcp-context.For MCP servers, tsx provides global state.
   elements such as mcp-server-manager.To show or update server data, tsx uses this context.
   API Communication:

4. Custom hooks retrieve information from MCP servers or APIs.
   The lib's utility functions manage data formatting or API calls.
   Rendering user interfaces:

5. The UI is constructed using components in ui/ (e.g., buttons, modals).
   For images or icons, public static assets are utilized.

Agent Interaction Lifecycle:

User input:

The user enters data through the user interface (e.g., typing a query or clicking a button).
Preparing the Request:

The input is prepared by the frontend and sent either directly to an MCP server or an AI provider as a request to the backend.
Backend/MCP Server Communication:

The request is processed by a backend or MCP server (for example, by sending it to an AI provider or querying a database).
Artificial Intelligence Processing:

After processing the request, the AI provider produces a response.
Handling Responses:

After receiving the response, it is parsed and formatted for display.
Response on Display:

The user interface shows the user the processed response.
Actions to Take Next:

The cycle is restarted when the user responds to the response or takes a subsequent action.
